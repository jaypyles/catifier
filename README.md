# Catifier

Catifier is a tool for generating cat images via AI.

Catifier is mostly just a toy application. The main purpose of this project was to focus on developing cloud resources using Terraform and automating workflows with GitHub Actions. While the app itself is a fun way to generate cat images, the underlying infrastructure and CI/CD processes are where the real learning and development took place.
